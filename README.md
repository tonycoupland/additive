# additive
Additive is an addictive tile sliding puzzle game where all you have to do is slide the tiles together to make the numbers 10 to 100!

Slide columns or rows of tiles together to add their contents, once you've made 10, keep sliding to make 20 then 30. If your tiles add up to more than 100, it will loop around and start again. Easy to play, very hard to master!

Work your way through four levels of difficultly from the easy to complete 'Junior' level through the the virtually impossible 'Genius' level.
